## Introduction (Welcome to QQ (tencent chatting program) groupï¼š97986046)
My purpose is to allow ThinkPad P52 to run mac OS mojave as natively as possible

Tips: If you want to use built-in network adapter, you'd better buy a new pcie card, and I suggest DW1560 or DW1830, considering baout the size and space. Also, P52 does not have whitelist upon WLAN hardware, you even do not need to modify your BIOS

## Updates (Until 2019/8/21)
- 10.15 beta 6 is supported
- Touchpad is supported, 5 finger-touch is detected
- Fans Speed could be detected
- Thunderbolt 3 was improved

## Updates (Until 2019/7/24)
- The new version uses ssdt, aka the hotpatch, and ThunderBolt 3 ports are supported, and eGPU is supported.
- 128G DDR4 version P52 can boot up
- Xeon E2176m version P52 can boot up
- Core i7-8750H, i7-8850H, i9-8959HK, Xeon E2176m are supported
- We are close to the perfect
- Brightness control hotkey works properly
- IR camera is disabled to avoid the default camera switched to IR camera
- Touch Screen & Stylus works

## Touchpad
- Solved with VoodooSMBus, and 5 finger could be detected
- ~~It seems that the full gesture will be enabled, I haven't tested it yet. If anyone has interest in it, try the kext, patches and instructions mentioned in the following link, [ELANSMBus](https://github.com/gokula/ELANSMBus)~~
## What do you need
- Lenovo ThinkPad P52 Series Notebook, It seems that P72 can also work with this clover, not tested
- Mojave disk image is prepared, normally .dmg file, 10.14 & 10.14.2 & 10 ver.14.3 version has been tested
- USB storage (at least 8 Gigabyte)
- Broadcom DW1560 or DW1830 WLAN PCIE card (DW1830 requires modified antenna)

## BIOS Configuration
- Boot mode: UEFI
